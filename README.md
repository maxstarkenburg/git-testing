# git-testing
Junk repo for testing a few Git- or GitHub-related things

For example, seeing if hashes change if/when:
 * repo is renamed: no apparent changes!
 * `main` branch is renamed (to test historical repos using `master`): no apparent changes!

Also several tests related to requiring Git repos as packages/requirements in composer.
